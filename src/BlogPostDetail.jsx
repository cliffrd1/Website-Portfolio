The resort was called Pahali and the entrance fee is 600 pesos consumable for food. As I step on the white beach of Malamawi, it was just beautiful. The sea water was clear, it's not rocky, and the people are nice. `,

      My first year in IT was asynchronous learning, I was self studying with basic programmming and explored the lessons, tools that our proffesors gave us. It was difficult for me at first to learn in that setting. Good thing everytime we meet, we always record our online meetings so that we can replay what our instructor taught us. There were times that I would think what if covid never really happened, I was wondering if what would be the case if it was on site learning. Overall, there was no problem at all and I learned a lot.`,
